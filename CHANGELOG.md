# Changelog

## 2.1.0 (1/27/18)

* Upgrades Bootstrap from v4 beta to v4.0.0
* Replaces deprecated eslint JSX spacing rule, fixes linting across the project

## 2.0.0 (1/31/2017) :tada:

Many of the core libraries and tools have had major releases, as they should, so this major release is to account for any breaking changes they've introduced. Most of the breakage occured with the Bootstrap upgrade from alpha to beta 3, but Bootstrap 4 should remain much more stable from beta to release. The rest of the updates were relatively painless. Hello React 16!

Major changes:

* React 15 -> React 16
* Webpack 2 -> Webpack 3
* Bootstrap 4 alpha -> Bootstrap 4 beta
* Implements Jest more fully with new lint rules and supporting dependencies
* Upgrade TravisCI's Node environment from 6 to 8
* All other dependencies upgraded, some including major version bumps
* various refactors and cleanup

## 1.0.0 (05/19/2017)

This marks the first release of the boilerplate! :tada:

Proper documentation is forthcoming, but everything is working as it should for the first release. Please kick the tires and run this off-road. If you find any problems or errors off the bat, please open an issue.
